# Microsoft Graph Bicep extension

The **Microsoft Graph Bicep extension** enables customers to manage a limited set of Identity/Graph resources (Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD) in Bicep templates (alongside Azure resources) through native Microsoft Graph APIs.
This unblocks Infrastructure-as-Code/DevOps outcomes for Azure customers and will close a long-standing platform gap and pain-point.

Customers can then use [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) or [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/) to [deploy Bicep templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-cli) and their set of Microsoft Azure and/or Microsoft Entra ID resources.

The [releases page](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-bicep-types/releases) provides details on the supported Microsoft Graph Bicep types and limitations.

To get going with Microsoft Graph Bicep extension, start with the [Bicep templates for Microsoft Graph resources public documentation](https://aka.ms/graphbicep).
