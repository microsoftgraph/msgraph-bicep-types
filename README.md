# Microsoft Graph Bicep extension (public preview)

[![Build Status](https://microsoftgraph.visualstudio.com/Graph%20Developer%20Experiences/_apis/build/status%2FBicep%20types%2FCI%20Build?branchName=main)](https://microsoftgraph.visualstudio.com/Graph%20Developer%20Experiences/_build/latest?definitionId=308&branchName=main)
[![NuGet Version](
https://buildstats.info/nuget/Microsoft.Graph.Bicep.Types?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Bicep.Types/)

The **Microsoft Graph Bicep extension** enables customers to manage a limited set of Identity/Graph resources (Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD) in Bicep templates (alongside Azure resources) through native Microsoft Graph APIs.
This unblocks Infrastructure-as-Code/DevOps outcomes for Azure customers and will close a long-standing platform gap and pain-point.

Customers can then use [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) or [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/) to [deploy Bicep templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-cli) and their set of Microsoft Azure and/or Microsoft Entra ID resources.

The [releases page](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-bicep-types/releases) provides details on the supported Microsoft Graph Bicep types and limitations for the public preview.

To get going with the public preview, start with the [Bicep templates for Microsoft Graph resources public documentation](https://aka.ms/graphbicep).
